# Flight-Insights-Using-MongoDB

The project will allow users to view certain statistics and data regarding recorded flights in the
U.S. from December 2013 to January 2017 using MongoDB, Python and AWS. The user will be able to view information to help
plan their flights based on what has happened in the past 3 years. With this data, the user can
plan ahead to accommodate occurrences such as delays, cancellations, flight time, etc.
Furthermore, the use would be able to view travel statistics such as most common destination
